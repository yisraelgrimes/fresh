# Work in Progress

Some things I'm in the middle of implementing:

## Markdown Funcions

- Added markdown-it to package dependencies
- Need to add a markdown workflow to gulp so that it compiles/watches automatically. Currently it only works manually. ie. Import the file in pug and then recompile pug.

`include:markdown-it link/to/your/file.md'

# Upcoming

- Demo/test project files to get people started.
- Auto import Luscious via gulp command (and also other sass importing options).
- Add 'delete upcoming.md' to the `gulp init` command.
